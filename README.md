  - Fallout 4
  - Fallout 4 VR
  - The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (not tested a whole lot)

### Building
- C++ 17 compiler required
- Use the included CMake lists for building - or simply include the headers and source in your project
- (optional) To get Catch2 for running the tests, install its [CMake package](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/cmake-integration.md#installing-catch2-from-git-repository) (or get it via vcpkg):
```bash
git clone -b v2.x https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
cd Catch2
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build/ --target install  #with admin elevation (or sudo) depending on your cmake prefix path
```

### Libraries used
- [half - IEEE 754-based half-precision floating point library (v1.12.0)](http://half.sourceforge.net/) for 16-bit floats
- [Miniball (v3.0)](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/gaertner/subdir/software/miniball.html) for generating bounding spheres
- [Catch2 (v2.x branch)](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) for running tests
